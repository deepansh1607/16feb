    "\n",
    "**Database:** A database is a structured collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated electronically. It serves as a central repository for storing and organizing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relational:** Data is organized into tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "* **Schema-driven:** Requires a predefined schema, defining the structure and relationships of data.\n",
    "* **ACID properties:** Adheres to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties for data integrity.\n",
    "* **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-relational:** Data is stored in various formats, such as key-value pairs, document stores, wide-column stores, or graph databases.\n",
    "* **Schema-less or flexible:** Can handle unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "* **Scalability:** Designed for horizontal scaling to handle large datasets and high loads.\n",
    "* **Examples:** MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | SQL Databases | NoSQL Databases |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Data Organization | Relational (tables, rows, columns) | Non-relational (key-value, document, wide-column, graph) |\n",
    "| Schema | Predefined (schema-driven) | Flexible or schema-less |\n",
    "| ACID Properties | Adheres to ACID | May or may not adhere to ACID |\n",
    "| Scalability | Vertical scaling (adding more powerful hardware) | Horizontal scaling (adding more nodes) |\n",
    "| Use Cases | Traditional business applications, data warehousing | Big data, real-time analytics, content management |\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary,** SQL databases are well-suited for structured data and traditional business applications, while NoSQL databases are more flexible and scalable for handling large datasets and diverse data types. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific requirements of your application, such as data structure, scalability, and performance needs.\n"

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Primary Key** is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that each entry can be uniquely identified and prevents duplicate records. The primary key must satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniqueness**: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique across the table.\n",
    "2. **Non-nullability**: A primary key cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "3. **Immutability**: The values of a primary key should ideally not change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: In a `students` table, the `student_id` can be a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE students (\n",
    "    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    age INT\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Foreign Key** is a column (or a set of columns) that creates a link between two tables. It refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two. Foreign keys enforce referential integrity, ensuring that the value in the foreign key column corresponds to a valid entry in the related table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Consider a `courses` table that references the `students` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE courses (\n",
    "    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    course_name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    student_id INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the `students` table, `student_id` serves as the primary key, uniquely identifying each student.\n",
    "- In the `courses` table, `student_id` is a foreign key that links each course to a specific student. It ensures that any `student_id` in the `courses` table must exist in the `students` table.\n",

    "Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of execution of SQL clauses in a query follows a specific sequence, which is important to understand for constructing and optimizing SQL queries. Hereâ€™s the general order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM**: This clause specifies the tables from which to retrieve the data. It is executed first to determine the data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **JOIN**: If there are any join operations (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN), they are processed next to combine data from multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **WHERE**: This clause filters the rows returned from the FROM and JOIN clauses, applying any specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **GROUP BY**: If you are aggregating data, the GROUP BY clause is executed next, grouping the filtered rows into sets based on specified columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **HAVING**: This clause filters the grouped data. It is similar to WHERE but is applied after grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **SELECT**: The SELECT clause determines which columns or expressions to return in the final result set. At this point, any calculated fields (like aggregates) are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **DISTINCT**: If specified, this removes duplicate rows from the result set after the SELECT clause has been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **ORDER BY**: This clause sorts the final result set based on specified columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **LIMIT/OFFSET**: If applicable, this limits the number of rows returned and can also specify an offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following SQL query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT name\n",
    "FROM students\n",
    "JOIN courses ON students.student_id = courses.student_id\n",
    "WHERE age > 18\n",
    "GROUP BY name\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(courses.course_id) > 1\n",
    "ORDER BY name\n",
    "LIMIT 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution order would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM students**\n",
    "2. **JOIN courses**\n",
    "3. **WHERE age > 18**\n",
    "4. **GROUP BY name**\n",
    "5. **HAVING COUNT(courses.course_id) > 1**\n",
    "6. **SELECT DISTINCT name**\n",
    "7. **ORDER BY name**\n",
    "8. **LIMIT 10**\n",
